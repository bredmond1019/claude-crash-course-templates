Now I want to work on the backend.

First I want to look at main.rs and services/ai_model.rs.
I already have a running version of the basic model in ai_model.rs 
that uses the command line to generate responses. I want to modify this 
so that it can generate responses in a web app through our websocket.

We'll probably need to build out the message model in models/message.rs 
We'll eventually need to build out a ChatServer and ChatSession and connect
all of this to our websocket handler.
