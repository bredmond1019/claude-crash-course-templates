I'm creating a Rust project and I need your help. 
I'm going to give you a description of the project and 
some drawings, and I'd like you to help me turn it into a real 
life rust project. 

Project Details:

AI Chat Bot Application for Customer Support

I want to create a chat bot for my Health Tech Startup company. 
I want this chat bot to be able to read through data and/or websites 
and answer any questions that a customer may have about our application. 
This application will utilize Rust on the backend and React on the 
frontend with Actix Web Framework and the use of Websockets for real 
time connections. The response to the user should be streams and updated 
in real time. The answers will generally be no longer than 3 - 5 sentences 
and either suggested links to read more info, or links directly where 
the answer was found. 

We have our help docs for customers stored on an external website that 
we can access through an API by passing back a query string. 

This project is mostly to get an MVP to demo and to learn how to 
build an application like this.

It should be able to handle concurrent requests well. 

If the question the User asks is very long, the application should 
send the question to the model and parse out just a few key words 
that we can pul out and send in our query string to the API. 


If the question is unrelated to Healthie or Clinical Care related items, 
or no documents were found in the API Search,

The model application should return a response to ask the user 
again for a more concise search.
